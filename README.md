kotlisp
=======

A home-made lisp project built on my parser combinator library,
[parsekt](https://github.com/absurdhero/parsekt),
and based loosely on the neat book at http://www.buildyourownlisp.com .

You must `git clone` parsekt and run `mvn install` in order to
compile and run this project.

To run the REPL from the command line run

    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="net.raboof.kotlisp.MainKt"`

Or run Main.kt in your IDE.
